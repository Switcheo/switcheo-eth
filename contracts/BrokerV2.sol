/// @title The BrokerV2 contract for Switcheo Exchange
/// @author Switcheo Network
/// @notice This contract faciliates Ethereum and Ethereum token trades
/// between users.
/// Users can trade with each other by making and taking offers without
/// giving up custody of their tokens.
/// Users should first deposit tokens, then communicate off-chain
/// with the exchange coordinator, in order to place orders.
/// This allows trades to be confirmed immediately by the coordinator,
/// and settled on-chain through this contract at a later time.
///
/// @dev Bit compacting is used in the contract to reduce gas costs, when
/// it is used, params are documented as bits(n..m).
/// This means that the documented value is represented by bits starting
/// from and including `n`, up to and excluding `m`.
/// For example, bits(8..16), indicates that the value is represented by bits:
/// [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
///
/// Bit manipulation of the form (data & ~(~uint(0) << m)) >> n is frequently
/// used to recover the value at the specified bits.
/// For example, to recover bits(2..7) from a uint8 value, we can use
/// (data & ~(~uint8(0) << 7)) >> 2.
/// Given a `data` value of `1101,0111`, bits(2..7) should give "10101".
/// ~uint8(0): "1111,1111" (8 ones)
/// (~uint8(0) << 7): "1000,0000" (1 followed by 7 zeros)
/// ~(~uint8(0) << 7): "0111,1111" (0 followed by 7 ones)
/// (data & ~(~uint8(0) << 7)): "0101,0111" (bits after the 7th bit is zeroed)
/// (data & ~(~uint8(0) << 7)) >> 2: "0001,0101" (matching the expected "10101")
///
/// Additionally, bit manipulation of the form data >> n is used to recover
/// bits(n..e), where e is equal to the number of bits in the data.
/// For example, to recover bits(4..8) from a uint8 value, we can use data >> 4.
/// Given a data value of "1111,1111", bits(4..8) should give "1111".
/// data >> 4: "0000,1111" (matching the expected "1111")
///
/// There is frequent reference and usage of asset IDs, this is a unique
/// identifier used within the contract to represent individual assets.
/// For all tokens, the asset ID is identical to the contract address
/// of the token, this is so that additional mappings are not needed to
/// identify tokens during deposits and withdrawals.
/// The only exception is the Ethereum token, which does not have a contract
/// address, for this reason, the zero address is used to represent the
/// Ethereum token's ID.

    /// The data is bit compacted for ease of index referencing and to reduce gas costs,
    /// i.e. data representing different types of information is stored within one 256 bit value.
    ///
    /// For efficient balance updates, the `_addresses` array is meant to contain a

    /// This allows combining multiple balance updates for a user asset pair
    /// into a single update by first calculating the total balance update for
    /// a pair at a specified index, then looping through the sums to perform
    /// the balance update.
    ///
    /// The added benefit is further gas cost reduction because repeated
    /// user asset pairs do not need to be duplicated for the calldata.
    ///
    /// The operator address and operator fee asset ID is enforced to be `address(0)`,
    /// this is because while a slot is needed, the actual operator address should
    /// be read directly from contract storage, and the operator fee asset ID is
    /// identical to the maker's / filler's feeAssetId.
    /// Enforcing this reduces calldata gas costs as zero bits cost less than
    /// non-zero bits.
    ///
    /// A tradeoff of compacting the bits is that there is a lower maximum value
    /// for offer and fill data, however the limits remain generally practical.
    ///
    /// For `offerAmount`, `wantAmount`, `feeAmount` values, the maximum value
    /// is 2^128. For a token with 18 decimals, this allows support for tokens
    /// with a maximum supply of 1000 million billion billion (33 zeros).
    /// In the case where the maximum value needs to be exceeded, a single
    /// offer / fill can be split into multiple offers / fills by the off-chain
    /// service.
    ///
    /// For nonces the maximum value is 2^72, or more than a billion billion (21 zeros).
    ///
    /// Offers and fills both encompass information about how much (offerAmount)
    /// of a specified token (offerAssetId) the user wants to offer and
    /// how much (wantAmount) of another token (wantAssetId) they want
    /// in return.
    ///
    /// Each match specifies how much of the match's `offer.offerAmount` should
    /// be transferred to the filler, in return, the offer's maker receives:
    /// `offer.wantAmount * match.takeAmount / offer.offerAmount` of the
    /// `offer.wantAssetId` from the filler.
    ///
    /// A few restirctions are enforced to ensure fairness and security of trades:
    /// 1. To prevent unfairness due to rounding issues, it is required that:
    /// `offer.wantAmount * match.takeAmount % offer.offerAmount == 0`.
    ///
    /// 2. Fills can be filled by offers which do not individually match
    /// the `fill.offerAmount` and `fill.wantAmount` ratio. As such, it is
    /// required that:
    /// fill.offerAmount == total amount deducted from filler for the fill's
    /// associated matches (excluding fees)
    /// fill.wantAmount == total amount credited to filler for the fill's
    /// associated matches (excluding fees)
    ///
    /// 3. The offer array must not consist of repeated offers. For efficient
    /// balance updates, a loop through each offer in the offer array is used
    /// to deduct the offer.offerAmount from the respective maker.
    /// If an offer has not been recorded by a previos `trade` call,
    /// and it the offer is repeated in the offers array, then there would be

    /// To enforce uniqueness, it is required that offer nonces are sorted in a
